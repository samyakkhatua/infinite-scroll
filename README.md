# Infinite Scroll using JS
## The Infinite Scroll Using JS project is a demonstration of how to implement infinite scrolling on a web page using JavaScript. It allows you to load and display a large list of items gradually as the user scrolls down the page, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.
The project utilizes JavaScript to dynamically load additional avatars pictures from http://xsgames.co/randomusers API, when the user reaches the end of the current content, eliminating the need for pagination or manual clicking of "Load More" buttons. This creates a smoother browsing experience and improves performance by reducing the initial page load time.
